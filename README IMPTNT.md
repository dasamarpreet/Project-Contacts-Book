# Project-Contacts-Book
HOW TO USE:

This project is totally made on Python3, using it on different version of Python may give you some errors.
You should download all the files inside one folder and then run the main.py file (to run this file, you need to install a Python IDE on your PC).
You can use the source code anywhere (but not for commercial use or selling)

Thank you!
